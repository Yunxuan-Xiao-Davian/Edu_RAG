# Academic Research Assistant with RAG System

## Project Overview
This project implements a self-adaptive **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system for academic research assistance. The application dynamically retrieves relevant academic documents based on user queries and leverages advanced language models for generating responses.

## Core Features

### Document Retrieval System:
- **ElasticSearch / FAISS**: Utilize Elasticsearch or FAISS for efficient, scalable document retrieval based on embeddings.
- **Academic API Integrations**: Integrate with external APIs such as arXiv, PubMed, Google Scholar for live document retrieval and search.
- **Custom Knowledge Base**: Users can upload and manage custom documents to build their own knowledge base.

### Generative Model Integration:
- **Multiple LLM Support**: Support for OpenAI, Deepseek, and Groq to generate answers based on retrieved documents.
- **Dynamic Context Adjustment**: Automatically adjust the context window for the language model depending on the relevance of retrieved documents.

### User Management:
- **Authentication**: Secure user authentication via JWT or OAuth 2.0.
- **Role-based Access Control**: Users can be granted different roles (admin, researcher, student) with corresponding permissions.

### API Management:
- **RESTful API**: Expose APIs to allow users to query documents, submit queries for answers, and manage documents.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to avoid excessive API usage and ensure fair access.
- **API Key Management**: Users can configure and securely store API keys for LLM providers.

### Data Storage & Indexing:
- Store user data, document metadata, and query history in MongoDB or PostgreSQL.
- ElasticSearch is used for efficient indexing and document retrieval.

### Document Search & Query Handling:
- **Document Search API**: Search for documents by keywords, topics, and embeddings-based similarity.
- **Custom Document Upload**: Allows users to upload their academic documents into a custom knowledge base.

## Tech Stack

### Backend Framework:
- **Node.js** with **Express.js** or **NestJS** for building scalable backend APIs.
- **GraphQL** or **REST API** depending on the system's complexity and requirements.

### Database:
- **MongoDB**: For storing unstructured document data and user-related information.
- **PostgreSQL**: For storing structured data such as user profiles and metadata.
- **Elasticsearch**: For indexing documents and providing fast search capabilities based on semantic similarity.

### LLM Integrations:
- **OpenAI GPT-3/4 API**: For generating natural language responses based on the documents.
- **Deepseek**: A high-performance LLM provider for better semantic understanding of academic content.
- **Groq**: A high-performance model for scalable inference, suitable for document-based queries.

### Authentication & Security:
- **JWT** (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user authentication and session management.
- **OAuth 2.0** for third-party authentication via services like Google, GitHub, etc.
- **Rate Limiting** with tools such as Express Rate Limit to prevent abuse.

### Containerization & Deployment:
- **Docker** for containerizing the backend service.
- **Kubernetes** for container orchestration and scaling.
- **CI/CD pipelines** for continuous integration and deployment using tools like GitHub Actions or Jenkins.

### API Gateway:
- Use **API Gateway** (e.g., Kong, AWS API Gateway) for routing, load balancing, and security.

## API Endpoints

- **POST /query**: Accepts user queries, retrieves relevant documents, and generates an answer using the selected LLM.
- **GET /document/{id}**: Fetch a document's metadata or content.
- **POST /document/upload**: Allows users to upload documents to build a custom knowledge base.
- **POST /authenticate**: User login with JWT or OAuth.
- **GET /models/{model_name}/generate**: Generate a response using the specified model based on the retrieved documents.
- **GET /documents/search**: Search documents using keywords or semantic similarity.

## Deployment & Scaling

### Containerization:
- **Docker** images for easy deployment and scaling.
- Use **Kubernetes** for orchestration and to scale the service automatically based on demand.

### CI/CD Pipeline:
- Set up a pipeline using **GitHub Actions** or **Jenkins** for automated testing and deployment.

## Security & Compliance

### Data Encryption:
- Ensure all communication is encrypted using **HTTPS**.
- Use **AES-256** encryption for sensitive data storage.

### Privacy:
- Comply with **GDPR** and other data protection regulations.
- Implement proper access controls to ensure data privacy and security.

## Monitoring & Logging

### Application Logs:
- Use **Winston** or **Pino** for logging requests, errors, and system events.
- Log important events and errors for better system observability.

### Metrics & Monitoring:
- Integrate with **Prometheus** and **Grafana** for system health and performance metrics.
- Use **Sentry** or **New Relic** for real-time error tracking and performance monitoring.
