Welcome to the Academic Research Assistant Project
Project Overview
URL: Academic Research Assistant

This project presents a state-of-the-art, self-adaptive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for academic research. Designed to dynamically retrieve and integrate relevant scholarly documents, the system enhances academic workflows by providing accurate, context-aware answers to complex research queries. Key features include:

Dynamic Document Retrieval: Seamlessly retrieves relevant academic documents from a variety of sources using advanced embedding-based similarity matching.
Context-Adaptive Window: Automatically adjusts the context window based on document relevance, ensuring precise, contextually rich responses.
Multi-LLM Support: Integrated support for multiple LLM providers, including OpenAI, Deepseek, and Groq, ensuring flexible and scalable model interactions.
Custom Knowledge Base Integration: Users can manually add documents to build their own custom knowledge base, making the system highly customizable for specific research needs.
Technologies & Frameworks
This cutting-edge application leverages modern AI and web technologies, including:

Vite, TypeScript, React for seamless front-end performance and dynamic user interfaces
shadcn-ui & Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive design
Hugging Face Transformers for powerful embeddings and language model interactions
Multiple LLM Providers: OpenAI, Deepseek, Groq for optimal model performance
API-Driven Architecture: Easy-to-configure API keys for robust integration with external systems
How to Edit the Project
There are several ways you can contribute to the project:

Use Lovable: The most convenient option! Simply visit the Lovable Project and start prompting. Changes made via Lovable are automatically committed to the repository.

Use your IDE: Clone the repository to your local machine and work with your preferred development tools. Pushed changes will reflect on Lovable after being committed.

bash
复制代码
# Step 1: Clone the repository
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install dependencies
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server
npm run dev
GitHub Direct Edit: Edit files directly in GitHub with the in-browser editor.

GitHub Codespaces: Launch a Codespace for an in-browser, fully integrated development environment.

Deployment
Deploying the project is simple! Open Lovable, click on Share -> Publish, and your application is ready for use.

Custom Domain Support
While custom domain support isn't available yet, you can deploy this project on Netlify under your own domain. Learn more in our docs: Custom Domains.

API Keys Configuration
To use the system’s LLM capabilities, you’ll need API keys for the supported providers. Follow these steps:

Click the API Settings button within the app.
Add your API keys for OpenAI, Deepseek, or Groq.
The API keys are securely stored in your browser's localStorage for privacy and security.
